# PIGNON
PIGNON is a protein-protein interaction (PPI)-guided functional enrichment analysis for quantitative proteomics. 
The bases of the algorithm measures the clustering of proteins with a shared Gene Ontology (GO) annotation within the provided PPI network weighted with quantitative proteomics data. The significance of this clustering measure is then estimated from a normal distribution approximated from a Monte Carlo Sampling Distribution. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, we assess the false discovery rate at various thresholds against a null model. We tested PIGNON using a breast cancer dataset generated by Tyanova et al. 

Instructions below to run PIGNON from the command line.
